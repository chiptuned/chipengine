# ChipEngine - Workflow Analysis

## 🎯 Applying Efficient Development Workflow

Following the principle: **"From 'let's code and see' to 'when we code, we know exactly where we're going'"**

## 📋 Definition of Ready Checklist

For each ticket to be "Definition of Ready":
- ✅ Title (user story format)
- ✅ Why (business justification)
- ✅ What (feature description) 
- ✅ Definition of Done (checkboxes)
- ✅ How (technical approach)
- ✅ Estimation (story points ≤5)
- ✅ Priority (P0/P1/P2/P3)

### 📥 BACKLOG (Need Full Conception)

**Issues #10, #11, #12, #14, #15**
- Basic user story format ✅
- Need detailed technical conception 🔧
- Priority assignment needed 📋

## 🚀 Recommended Development Flow

### Weekend 1 Priority (Ready for "🔍 Today")
1. **Issue #4** (3pts) - Play RPS → Move to "In Progress"
2. **Issue #5** (5pts) - Bot API → Move to "For Sprint" 
3. **Issue #8** (3pts) - Deployment → Move to "For Sprint"

**Total**: 11 points = Perfect for 2-day weekend sprint

### Technical Conception Needed
1. **Issue #6** → Schedule conception workshop
2. **Issue #7** → Create research spike ticket  
3. **Issue #9** → PokerHandEvaluator research needed
4. **Issue #13** → Architecture design session

## 🎯 Workflow Implementation

### Board Organization
**Current State**: All tickets in "📥 Backlog"
**Action Required**:
- Move Issues #4, #5, #8 to "🏃 For Sprint"
- Move Issue #4 to "🔍 Today" for immediate start
- Keep others in "🔧 Technical Conception"

### Development Rules (From Workflow)
- ✅ **One dev = One ticket** (perfect for solo weekend coding)
- ✅ **Tickets ≤ 5 points** (all current tickets comply)
- ✅ **Complete before taking next** (flow preservation)
- ✅ **Technical "How" before development** (avoid surprises)

### Success Metrics
- **Weekend 1**: Complete Issues #4, #5, #8 (11 points)
- **Review time**: <24h (self-review for solo dev)
- **Estimation accuracy**: Track actual vs estimated time
- **Flow preservation**: No context switching between tickets

## 🚦 Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Move ready tickets to appropriate workflow stages
2. **This week**: Schedule technical conception for unclear tickets  
3. **Weekend 1**: Start with Issue #4 (clearest path to implementation)
4. **Continuous**: Maintain workflow discipline

This analysis ensures **"When we code, we know exactly where we're going"** ✨
