# ChipEngine - Project Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision
Build a lean, extensible platform for bot competitions. Start simple with Rock Paper Scissors, prove the architecture, then expand to Poker and beyond.

## ðŸ“… Timeline Overview

```
Week 1-2: Iteration 1 (RPS MVP)
â”œâ”€â”€ Core game engine
â”œâ”€â”€ Web interface 
â”œâ”€â”€ Bot API
â””â”€â”€ Basic tournaments

Week 3-4: Iteration 2 (Multi-game Platform)  
â”œâ”€â”€ Poker implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ Game selection
â”œâ”€â”€ Extended bot API
â””â”€â”€ Architecture validation

Week 5+: Scale & Polish
â”œâ”€â”€ Performance optimization
â”œâ”€â”€ Advanced features
â””â”€â”€ New games
```

## ðŸš€ Iteration 1: RPS MVP (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Working website that bot developers can actually use

### Critical Path Issues
1. **#4** - Play Rock Paper Scissors *(frontend + api)*
2. **#5** - Bot REST API *(api)*  
3. **#13** - BaseGame Interface *(architecture)*
4. **#8** - One-Command Deployment *(devops)*

### Supporting Features
- **#6** - Game Stats & History *(frontend + api)*
- **#7** - Tournament System *(api)*
- **#14** - Real-time Updates *(frontend + api)*
- **#15** - Testing Coverage *(quality)*

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Working RPS website deployed
- [ ] 5+ bot developers using API
- [ ] 100+ games played
- [ ] Sub-100ms API response times
- [ ] Zero critical bugs

## ðŸŽ° Iteration 2: Multi-Game Platform (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Prove architecture scales to multiple games

### Core Features  
1. **#9** - Poker Game Implementation *(poker + api)*
2. **#10** - Poker Bot API *(poker + api)*
3. **#12** - Hand Evaluation *(poker + performance)*
4. **#11** - Game Selection *(frontend)*

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Both RPS and Poker working
- [ ] Same bot interface works for both games
- [ ] Tournaments for both game types
- [ ] Architecture proven extensible
- [ ] Easy to add 3rd game

## ðŸ“‹ Issue Organization

### By Priority
**Critical (MVP Blockers)**:
- #4 (Play RPS), #5 (Bot API), #8 (Deployment), #13 (BaseGame)

**High (Iteration Goals)**:
- #1 (Epic 1), #6 (Stats), #7 (Tournaments), #9 (Poker), #10 (Poker API)

**Medium (Quality & UX)**:
- #11 (Game Selection), #12 (Hand Eval), #14 (Real-time), #15 (Testing)

**Low (Future)**:
- #2 (Epic 2), #3 (Epic 3) - Planning only

### By Component
**API/Backend**: #5, #7, #8, #9, #10, #12, #13, #14, #15  
**Frontend**: #4, #6, #11, #14, #15  
**RPS Game**: #1, #4, #5, #6, #7  
**Poker Game**: #2, #9, #10, #11, #12  
**Infrastructure**: #3, #8, #13, #14, #15

## ðŸŽ® Development Strategy

### Weekend Coding Sessions
1. **Weekend 1**: Issues #4, #5, #13 (Core RPS + API)
2. **Weekend 2**: Issues #6, #7, #8 (Stats + Tournaments + Deploy)
3. **Weekend 3**: Issues #9, #10, #12 (Poker Core)
4. **Weekend 4**: Issues #11, #14, #15 (Polish + Testing)

### Technical Approach
- **Lean Development**: Ship working features fast
- **API-First**: Web UI is just another client
- **Isolated Functions**: Easy to test and optimize
- **Real User Testing**: Deploy early, get feedback

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with simplest game (RPS) to validate architecture
- Deploy early and often for real user feedback
- Keep poker integration separate to avoid complexity
- Comprehensive testing to catch regressions

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

### Week 2 (RPS MVP)
- [ ] Working deployment at public URL
- [ ] 5+ external bot developers testing API
- [ ] 100+ games played through platform
- [ ] <100ms average API response time
- [ ] Zero data loss or critical bugs

### Week 4 (Multi-Game)
- [ ] Both RPS and Poker fully playable
- [ ] Same bot authentication works for both games
- [ ] Tournaments running for both game types
- [ ] Architecture documented and extensible
- [ ] Third game can be added in <1 day

### Week 8 (Scale)
- [ ] 1000+ registered users
- [ ] 10+ unique bot implementations
- [ ] Sub-50ms API response times
- [ ] Swiss tournament system
- [ ] Analytics dashboard

## ðŸ”„ Iteration Planning

This roadmap follows agile principles:
- **2-week iterations** aligned with weekend coding
- **User story breakdown** with clear DoD
- **Continuous deployment** for fast feedback
- **Retrospectives** to improve process

Each issue includes:
- **Why**: Business justification
- **What**: Feature description
- **DoD**: Checkbox requirements
- **How**: Technical approach
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Given/When/Then

Ready for 10x weekend development! ðŸš€
